## DocRED:

####  How to download?
Due to the large data size, the original data can be downloaded from the open-source repository of the original paper "[DocRED: A Large-Scale Document-Level Relation Extraction Dataset](http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/P19-1074)". 

```
Yuan Yao, Deming Ye, Peng Li, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Lixin Huang, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. 2019. Docred: A large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL, pages 764–777. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Put all files of "``docred``" into the "``dataset/docred/``" directory of the code.



## DWIE

The dataset was obtained using the same preprocessing method as Ru et al. in the paper "[Learning logic rules for document-level relation extraction](http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.emnlp-main.95)"
